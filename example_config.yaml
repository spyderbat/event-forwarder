#   authentication:
#     method: bearer # [ bearer | basic | hmac | shared_secret | default=none ]
#     parameters:
#       header_name: X-HMAC # value required for hmac and shared_secret
#       secret_key: base64-encoded-bearer-token # value required for bearer, hmac, and shared_secret
#       hash_algo: sha256 # required for "hmac" authentication method; must be "sha256"
